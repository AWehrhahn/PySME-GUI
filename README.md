About the GUI
=============

*The Gui is still in early development, so everything is likely to change.*

The GUI is based on Electron, which means its basically a Chrome browser.
The Python code acts as a seperate server thread, which is accessed via zerorpc.


Installation
============

1. Install npm and node.js
2. `npm install`, this requires c++ compilers on windows (from visual studio)
3. `npm start`
